Here are a few techniques:\n","\n","**Deleting Rows:** This is the simplest approach, where you delete rows that have missing values. This approach is only advisable if the number of missing values is small and if you believe that they are missing randomly.\n","\n","**Imputation:** Imputation involves filling missing values with either a measure of central tendency, like the mean or median, or with some other value. There are multiple types of imputation including single, multiple, and regression imputation.\n","\n","**Prediction Models:** In this case, the missing values are predicted using machine learning models. The features with complete data are used to model the feature that has missing data, and this model is then used to predict the missing values. Techniques such as regression, KNN (K-nearest neighbors), and random forests can be used for prediction.\n","\n","**Interpolation:** This method assumes that the data follows a certain trend, and missing values are filled based on this trend.\n","\n","**Advanced Imputation Techniques:** Techniques such as MICE (Multivariate Imputation by Chained Equations), where multiple imputations are performed and averaged, or Deep Learning-based techniques, which can handle non-linear data and high-dimensional spaces, can be used.\n"],"metadata":{"id":"qtOCwHgOwtNn"}},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":1,"metadata":{"id":"VxMFbMcisAGt","colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1689033107774,"user_tz":-330,"elapsed":3589,"user":{"displayName":"HARSHIT
